# **GitHub Self-Hosted Runner on Azure**

This repository contains a workflow to deploy a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner on an Azure virtual machine. The runner is configured to connect to a specified GitHub repository or organization and is suitable for various CI/CD workloads.

---

## **Requirements**
### **GitHub App Setup**
To use this workflow, you must have a GitHub App with the following setup:
- Navigate to Settings > Developer Settings > GitHub Apps.
- Create a new GitHub App with the following organization permissions:
    - Self-hosted runners: Read & Write
    - Metadata: Read
- After creating the app, generate a Private Key
    - Download the private key file
    - Base64-encode the private key
    ```bash
    cat <private-key.pem> | base64 -w0 
    ```
- Store the following details as GitHub secrets in your repository
    - APP_ID: The App ID of your GitHub App
    - APP_KEY: The Base64-encoded private key
### **Azure Credentials**    
You need to provide Azure credentials as a secret in your repository for the workflow to interact with Azure resources.
- Create a Service Principal with appropriate permissions:
    - The Contributor role is required to manage Azure resources like VMs and resource groups.
    ```bash
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "GitHubRunnerSP" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription-id> --sdk-auth
    # Replace <subscription-id> with your Azure Subscription ID.
    ```
- Copy the output JSON securely and store it as a GitHub secret:
    - AZURE_SP: Paste the entire JSON output as the value of this secret.
Example JSON:

    ```json
    {
      "clientId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "clientSecret": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "subscriptionId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "tenantId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
      "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
      "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
      "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
      "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
      "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
    }
    
    ```
